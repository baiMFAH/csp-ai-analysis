# DuckDuckGo Search Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The `search_duckduckgo()` function in `src/link_analysis_utils.py` was causing timeouts when processing text references to AI resources.

### Root Cause
- **DuckDuckGo is not accessible** from your network environment
- `curl` test confirmed: Connection timeout after 5 seconds
- Python requests also timeout after 15 seconds
- Likely blocked by firewall, proxy, or network restrictions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Disabled DuckDuckGo Search
Modified `search_for_resource()` in `src/link_analysis_utils.py` to:
- Skip DuckDuckGo web search entirely (commented out)
- Display warning message: "Web search disabled (DuckDuckGo not accessible)"
- Only use direct URL pattern matching

### 2. Enhanced Direct URL Pattern Matching
Expanded `attempt_direct_url_construction()` to handle more cases:

**Added patterns for:**
- **YouTube**: Karpathy's Zero to Hero course
- **Coursera**: Andrew Ng courses (ML, Deep Learning)
- **DeepLearning.AI**: General courses
- **fast.ai**: Practical deep learning
- **Udemy**: Python courses
- **edX**: Harvard CS50, MIT courses
- **Stanford**: CS229, CS231n
- **O'Reilly**: Books and learning platform

### 3. Created Diagnostic Test Script
Created `src/test_search.py` to diagnose search issues:
- Tests basic DuckDuckGo connectivity
- Tests alternative URLs
- Tests different User-Agent headers
- Tests general internet connectivity
- Tests the actual `search_duckduckgo()` function

## Impact

**Before:**
- Notebook would hang/timeout when processing text references
- Could take 15+ seconds per text reference to fail
- Made the analysis pipeline unusable

**After:**
- Text references are quickly matched against known patterns
- No timeouts or hanging
- Fast execution (< 1 second per item)
- Falls back gracefully for unmatched resources

## Limitations

**Current approach:**
- Only works for resources explicitly coded in `attempt_direct_url_construction()`
- Won't discover new/unknown resources automatically
- Requires manual addition of new patterns

**To resolve text references for unknown resources:**
1. Add specific patterns to `attempt_direct_url_construction()`
2. Use alternative search API (Google Custom Search, Bing API)
3. Manually provide URLs in the survey data

## Testing

To verify the fix works, run the notebook cells:
- Cell 23: Should complete without timeouts
- Should see messages: "⚠️ Web search disabled (DuckDuckGo not accessible)"
- Text references with known patterns will be resolved
- Unknown text references will be marked as "text_only"

## Alternative Solutions (for future)

If you need web search functionality:

### Option 1: Use Google Custom Search API
```python
# Requires API key and setup
# https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview
```

### Option 2: Use Bing Search API
```python
# Requires Azure subscription
# https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/apis/bing-web-search-api
```

### Option 3: Use SerpAPI
```python
# Paid service but reliable
# https://serpapi.com/
```

### Option 4: VPN/Proxy
- If DuckDuckGo is blocked, use VPN to access it
- Configure proxy settings in requests

## Files Modified

1. **src/link_analysis_utils.py**
   - Line 355-407: Disabled DuckDuckGo search in `search_for_resource()`
   - Line 200-285: Enhanced `attempt_direct_url_construction()`

2. **notebooks/completion_rate_report.ipynb**
   - Cell 23: Uses updated `search_for_resource()` function

3. **src/test_search.py** (new file)
   - Diagnostic tests for search functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Run the notebook** - Should work without timeouts now
2. **Check output** - Review which text references were resolved
3. **Add patterns** - For any unresolved resources you want to match, add patterns to `attempt_direct_url_construction()`
4. **Consider API** - If you need comprehensive web search, implement one of the alternative solutions above
