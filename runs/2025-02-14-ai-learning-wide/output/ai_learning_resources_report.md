## Methodology & Limitations
- Summaries derive from Wide Research raw captures stored under `runs/2025-02-14-ai-learning-wide/raw`.
- Metrics columns preserve course ratings/enrollment counts verbatim where provided to satisfy the no-abbreviation requirement.
- Slack channel entry lacks public scrapeable content; retained original submitter context and flagged for qualitative follow-up.
